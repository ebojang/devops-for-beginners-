Assignment 1 — VPC & Networking (AWS)
A full custom network built from scratch to learn the fundamentals of cloud networking, routing, and segmentation.
🎯 Objective
Create a custom VPC with one public and one private subnet, configure routing for internet access, and deploy EC2 instances across them.

🧭 What You’ll Build

VPC (e.g. 10.0.0.0/16)
Subnets: one public (10.0.1.0/24) and one private (10.0.2.0/24)
Internet connectivity: IGW + NAT Gateway
Route tables wired correctly
EC2 instances in each subnet
Security groups for least-privilege access
(Bonus) Bastion host and CloudWatch monitoring


🛠️ Step-by-Step (AWS Console)
1) Create the VPC & Subnets

VPC → Create VPC

Name: assignment1-vpc
CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16


Subnets → Create two subnets (same AZ)

Public: 10.0.1.0/24 (Name: public-subnet-a)
Private: 10.0.2.0/24 (Name: private-subnet-a)


Public Subnet → Edit subnet settings → Enable auto-assign public IPv4

2) Internet Access

Internet Gateway → Create IGW (assignment1-igw) → Attach to assignment1-vpc
Elastic IP → Allocate new address
NAT Gateway → Create in public subnet, attach the Elastic IP

3) Route Tables

Public Route Table (public-rt)
Associate with public subnet
Add route: 0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway


Private Route Table (private-rt)
Associate with private subnet
Add route: 0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway



4) Security Groups

Public EC2 SG (sg-public)
Inbound:
SSH (22) from your IP only
HTTP (80) from your IP (or 0.0.0.0/0 if you’ll host a test web page)
Outbound: allow all

Private EC2 SG (sg-private)
Inbound:
SSH (22) from sg-public (reference the SG)
Outbound: allow all



5) EC2 Instances

Public EC2

AMI: Amazon Linux 2 / latest
Subnet: public-subnet-a
Auto-assign public IP: Enabled
SG: sg-public
User data (optional) to serve a simple page:
Shell#!/bin/bashyum update -yyum install -y httpdecho "Hello from Public EC2" > /var/www/html/index.htmlsystemctl enable httpdsystemctl start httpdShow more lines



Private EC2

AMI: Amazon Linux 2 / latest
Subnet: private-subnet-a
Auto-assign public IP: Disabled
SG: sg-private
