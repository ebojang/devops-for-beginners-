7 LAYERS
==Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away== 

Layer 7- **Application** -  provides network services directly to applications. components are : Http. smtp, ftp etc. 

Layer 6 - **Presentation** - ensures data is in usable format. it encrypts data and aid in data formatting. convert jpeg into a real format

Layer 5 - **Session** - it establishes, maintain and terminate connections between applications.
components of L5, authentication 

Layer 4 - **Transport** - is responsible for reliable data transfer to the upper layers. it enables data to arrive in the right sequence. it promotes end-end connections.  protocols of L4 are TCP and UDP

Layer 3 - **Network** - manages packet forwarding including routing through intermediate routers. 
it determines the path data is transferred to different networks. components of L3 are routers and IP addresses 

Layer 2 - **Data link** - put your data into frames (envelopes) and ensures data is transferred correctly between adjacent network nodes. components of data link layer are MAC addresses , switched & Bridges.

Layer 1 - **Physical** : transmits raw bit stream over a physical medium such as fibre, cables and NIC

TCP/ IP MODEL LAYERS 

**APPLICATION LAYER** > http, tls , dns etc 
**Transport Layer** > tcp, udp
**INTERNET LAYER** > IP
**NETWORK ACCESS LAYER** > Ethernet, wireless LAN
