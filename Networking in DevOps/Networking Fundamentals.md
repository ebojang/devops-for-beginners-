Networking- is the practice of connecting computers and other devices together so they can share information, resources and access the internet.

**Local Area Network (LAN)**- is a network that connects devices within small local area such as home, office and school.
They are fast and secure due to their limited range.

**Wide Area Network (WAN)-** connect devices across large geographical areas, such as cities, countries and continents. example of WAN is the internet.
WANs often use public infrastructure (like telephone lines, satellites, a VPN over the internet) and are typically slower than LANs due to distance and scale.

**How WAN connects multiple LANs**
Every LAN is connected to a router> Routers in point A & B are connected via WAN links (fibre optic cables, satelites links, cellular networks and the internet) > arrive at destination router and enters target LAN. 
The data travels **from LAN → router → WAN → router → LAN**.

==IMPORTANCE OF NETWORKING IN DEVOPS== 
 * enables communication between servers and applications
 * critical for launching and updating applications 
 * crucial in monitoring and managing infrastructure
 * enhances troubleshooting, performance and scalability

==Key Networking Components:==
**Switches** - connects devices within the same LAN and allow them to communicate effectively.
it uses MAC addresses to forward data.
**Routers**- is a layer 3 device connects different networks together. eg home LAN to the internet.
router assigns IP addresses to devices on your network
it decides the best path for data travel.
**Firewalls** - protects networks from unauthorised access. They monitor and control incoming and outgoing networks. firewalls can be physical device (often in routers) or software (windows firewall).
