AMAZON ROUTE 53

Amazon Route 53 is AWS managed DNS service.
* it is highly available, scalable and fully managed.
Route 53 acts as an authoritative DNS, meaning you control DNS records for your domains (add, update, delete).
Provides health checks to monitor resources and reroute traffic if a server fails
Integrated with AWS to manage traffic flow to resources like EC2, load balancers, etc.
Lets you buy and manage domain names (like GoDaddy or Cloudflare).


ROUTE53 HOSTED ZONES
A Hosted Zone in Route 53 is like a container that stores all DNS records for a domain and its subdomains. It tells Route 53 how to route traffic.
Hosted zones define whether traffic goes to the public web or stays internal within AWS VPCs.
A public hosted zone routes traffic on the internet, while a private hosted zone routes traffic within AWS VPCs.

Why would you use a private hosted zone instead of a public one?
A3: To keep DNS resolution internal to your VPC for security and isolation, ensuring internal services aren’t exposed to the internet.

DNS 
DNS (Domain Name System) is the system that translates human-friendly domain names (like google.com) into machine-friendly IP addresses (like 172.217.18.36). This translation is essential because computers communicate using IP addresses, not names.
DNS uses hierarchical structure: Top-Level Domain (TLD): .com, .org, .net
Second-Level Domain: example.com
Subdomain: www.example.com or api.example.com


What happens if DNS fails?
If DNS fails, users cannot access websites using domain names because the system cannot resolve them to IP addresses.

DNS TERMINOLOGIES:
1) Domain registrar: a service where you buy and register domain (eg GoDaddy, AWS Route53 etc)'
2) DNS Record:Instructions for your domain that tell the internet where to send traffic
3) Zone File: A directory that contains all DNS records for a domain.
4) Nameserver: The server that resolves DNS queries and decides if the answer is authoritative. it is where your domain is hosted.
5) TLD (Top-Level Domain): The highest level in DNS hierarchy, like .com, .org, .gov.
6) SLD (Second-Level Domain): The part you register, like amazon in amazon.com.

CNAME VS ALIAS 
Cname: maps an alis domain name to a canonical (true) domain name. example: www.ebojang.com -> ebojang.com
note: cname only works for subdomains, not the root domain. they are commonly used for pointing www or other subdomains to another domain.
ALIAS: points a hostname to an AWS resource. it is often implemented by DNS providers as a workaround 


ROUTE53: ROUTING POLICIES 
Routing policies in Amazon Route 53 define how DNS responds to queries. They don’t actually route traffic like a load balancer; they just tell DNS which IP or resource to return when someone looks up your domain.

Types of ROUTE53 routing policies:
1) simple routing - always returns the same ip address for a domain.
2) Weighted routing - distributes traffic based on weights (eg 70% to server A, 30% to server B). useful for testing or gradual migrations.
3) Failover routing: if primary routing fails, traffic goes to a backup
4) Latency-based routing - sends users to the server that responds fastest
